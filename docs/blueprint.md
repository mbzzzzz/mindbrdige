# **App Name**: MindBridge AI - Universal Web Accessibility Intelligence Platform

## Core Features:

- Real-Time Content Simplification: Use Chrome's Rewriter API to simplify web content based on user-defined reading levels. This tool transforms content in real-time to adapt to the user's preferred complexity. ENHANCED: Adaptive learning system that automatically detects user's optimal complexity level, Visual complexity indicators with color-coded difficulty levels (green=easy, yellow=medium, red=complex), Context preservation engine maintains meaning while simplifying structure, Undo/Redo functionality with visual diff highlighting changes, Smart sentence restructuring for better comprehension flow
- Multi-Language Translation: Leverage Chrome's Translator API to translate web content into multiple languages, breaking down language barriers for users. ENHANCED: Cultural context adaptation beyond literal translation, Visual content translation for images, diagrams, and infographics using AI, Regional language variations (Spanish-Mexico vs Spanish-Spain), Slang and colloquialism detection with appropriate formal alternatives, Bi-directional learning that improves translation accuracy over time
- Summarization Tool: Generate summaries of varying lengths using the Summarizer API to help users quickly grasp key information on a page. ENHANCED: Four-tier intelligent layering system: Overview (30-second read), Key Points (2-minute read), Details (5-minute read), Complete (original content), Purpose-driven summaries optimized for study, work, or casual reading, Visual summary generation converting text to mind maps and flowcharts, Reading progress tracking through summary levels, Interactive summary navigation with jump-to-section functionality
- Clarity Optimization: Improve the clarity and readability of web content using the Proofreader API. ENHANCED: Real-time readability scoring with improvement suggestions, Sentence structure optimization for cognitive accessibility, Jargon detection and replacement with simpler alternatives, Reading flow analysis with recommendations for better comprehension, Grammar simplification without changing meaning
- User Preference Settings: Allow users to set their preferred reading level, language, and visual style in a persistent settings panel. ENHANCED: AI-powered preference learning from user behavior, Context-aware settings that adapt based on website type and user goals, Accessibility profile templates for common needs (dyslexia, ADHD, vision impairment), Sync across devices with cloud-based preference storage, Quick-switch profiles for different use cases (work, study, leisure)
- Accessibility Panel: Provide a user-friendly panel within the Chrome Extension to adjust accessibility settings and view real-time content transformations. ENHANCED: Smart floating panel that appears contextually, One-click transformation buttons for instant accessibility features, Real-time preview mode showing before/after transformations, Accessibility compliance scoring with WCAG 2.1 indicators, Voice control integration for hands-free operation
- Content Analysis and Adaptation: Utilize the Prompt API to analyze web content and automatically adapt it based on detected user needs. ENHANCED: Advanced content intelligence engine analyzing: Content complexity scoring (readability, technical density, structure), User struggle detection (reading patterns, time spent, scrolling behavior), Automatic adaptation triggers based on content type and user history, Semantic content mapping for better context understanding, Personalized improvement suggestions based on individual user data
- Cognitive Load Manager: Real-time overwhelm detection through reading pattern analysis, Automatic content chunking when cognitive load exceeds user capacity, Strategic break suggestions with motivational progress indicators, Energy-based adaptation adjusting complexity based on time of day and user alertness, Focus enhancement modes with distraction filtering
- Smart Content Prediction Engine: Next-question anticipation predicting user information needs, Relevant example generation before user requests clarification, Concept connection mapping linking related ideas across content, Proactive explanation bubbles for potentially confusing terms, Learning path suggestions for deeper understanding
- Universal Learning Modes: Visual Learning Mode: Automatic conversion of text to diagrams, flowcharts, and infographics, Audio Learning Mode: Screen reader optimization with enhanced TTS formatting, Interactive Learning Mode: Content transformation into Q&A and quiz formats, Narrative Learning Mode: Complex information rewritten as engaging stories, Kinesthetic Learning Mode: Interactive elements and hands-on explanations
- Intelligent API Orchestration System: Dynamic API combination logic using multiple Chrome AI APIs simultaneously, Performance-optimized processing with sub-second response times, Context-aware API selection choosing optimal APIs based on content analysis, Feedback loop integration improving API combinations through user interaction data, Custom transformation pipelines for specific content types and user needs
- Personal Impact Analytics Dashboard: Reading speed improvement tracking with before/after metrics, Comprehension scoring through built-in mini-assessments, Daily achievement system celebrating learning milestones, Progress streaks and gamification encouraging consistent usage, Detailed usage analytics showing accessibility feature effectiveness
- Auto-Detection and Proactive Assistance: Struggle pattern recognition identifying when users need help before they ask, Automatic feature suggestions based on content analysis and user behavior, Adaptive settings optimization learning user preferences across different contexts, Predictive accessibility needs anticipating requirements before user awareness, Smart intervention timing offering help at optimal moments

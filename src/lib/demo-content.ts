    content: `The Industrial Revolution, a period from the 18th to the 19th century, was a pivotal moment in history that saw the transition from agrarian and handicraft-based economies to economies based on industrial manufacturing. This era began in Great Britain and spread to other parts of the world. Key innovations included the steam engine, which powered factories, locomotives, and ships; the spinning jenny and power loom, which revolutionized textile production; and the development of iron and steel production processes. These technological advancements led to a massive increase in production capacity, urbanization as people moved to cities for factory work, and the rise of a new industrial working class. While it brought about significant economic growth and improvements in some aspects of life, it also created new social problems, including poor working conditions, child labor, and overcrowded cities.`

    content: `Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to process information in fundamentally new ways. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows them to solve certain complex problems, like cryptographic code-breaking and molecular simulation, exponentially faster than any classical computer.`
